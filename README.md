# InvPOS
Inventory POS management system is a simple web-based solution to track sales activity. Our project provides an admin anduser dashboard which allow users to create an account and login. This application also provides category modules  and structures our site in a hierarchical fashion.

In addition to all this, the sales module and report module enable us to look a tour sales and any necessary action regarding point of sale as and when  required. The application generates sales reports in detail based on many parameters like products, hours, employees, the total cost of items, retail amount, etc. along with graphs and charts based on sales performance.

All these features make it easy for the user to use our application and keeptrack of the products in a store.
